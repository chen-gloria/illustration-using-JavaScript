# Artist Statement

It’s easy for us to forget loving people who are close to us, especially our parents. This major project is about loving your closest people, and moreover, any people who loves you.

It’s a story about growth of heart and soul. The story encompasses a person's growth, from childhood -> teenager -> university student -> adulthood. The rough story line is described as below:

A man listened a lot of his mother's words during childhood. After grown up, he left home. His mother got sick one day, but he was too far away from home and was too busy to go back to see his mother. Soon, his mother passed away. The man was in desperate sorrow. He started to realise that he hasn’t listened for his mother's words for long time. He couldn’t get rid of his sorrow until a special day. It was a peaceful and lovely afternoon; he was taking a snap under the soft sunshine. In his dream, his mother gave him a call, spoke warmly with him. He listened, listened, he felt so satisfied. It was a beautiful dream as he felt he was with his mother all the time. After he waked up, he started to cherish and love important people in his life.

There are three main scenes, each scene contains 4 sub-parts:
1) About growth and leaving home
a. The man was born in a beautiful town, when he was a baby, even though he couldn't speak, he loved listening to his mother. Every time when his mother was talking to him, he was joyful. 
b. During his process of growing, his mother never stopped devoting all her attention to him. She took care of every aspect of his life.
c. After he grew up, he started his rebellion period. He started to argue and dispute with his mother. He started to be independent and had his own thoughts.
d. He decided to leave to another city far away from home and pursue his dream and goals.

2) Receiving bad news and memory of his mother
a. He started to live in another city to pursue his career goals. He became very busy, and barely had time to visit his mother. His mother called, but he didn't listen carefully.
b. He received bad news about his mother's disease, he didn't know what he should do. He was still busy but started to think about the meaning of life.
c. Unfortunately, his mother passed away soon after not being cured. 
d. He started to recall his memory with his mother, especially his mother’s favourite song.

3) Start his new life after dreaming his mother
a. It was a beautiful afternoon with soft sunshine, he was listening his mother’s favourite song alone at home.
b. He felt sleepy and fell into a dream.
c. In his dream, his mother appeared, they had a warm conversation. She reminded him to take care of himself and cherish important people around him.
d. After he waked up, he started his new life to cherish and love important person in his life.

At the beginning, the viewer may a sense of happy feeling. The viewer may start to feel sad because of his leaving. After his mother's death, the viewer may feel deeper sorrow. At the end, the viewer may feel hopeful about life and think about the meaning of life. The viewer may start to think about cherishing and loving important people around him.

I hope the viewers will feel they should start to love their closed people more; remember how they love them and love them back; start to care about their friends, families, children, neighbours; love others like love themselves.
