# Interaction Statement

Write your interaction statement in this file (max 500 words).

In my work, I used a lot of features to allow viewers to interact with my scenes, such as buttons, key pressed and so on. In my project, I used a very special way to display. All the scenes were hand-painted. I tried to simulate the flip book display method and displayed the scences frame by frame. If the painting is detailed enough, the viewer can see my mother's love for the child, the child's growth, and later reflections from my picture. I hope that my work will remind everyone of their favorite people and learn to love them.
